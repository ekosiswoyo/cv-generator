## 🧠 Why CleanCV?

Most CV builders require accounts and store sensitive personal data on their servers.  
CleanCV takes a different approach:

> Your CV belongs to you — not a platform.

Everything is processed locally in your browser, making CleanCV ideal for users who value privacy, simplicity, and long-term control.
